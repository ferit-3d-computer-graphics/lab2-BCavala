# Lab 2: Interactive 3D Visualization and Coordinate Systems, Point Clouds and Voxel Rendering

In this lab, you will learn how to construct interactive 3D scenes using helper tools such as axesHelper, 
explore transformations using the model_matrix_timeseries, and understand camera controls via interactive demos.
We will explore the representation and manipulation of point clouds and voxel-based data structures. 
Students will experiment with interactive tools to edit, visualize, and compress 3D data.

Learning objectives:
- After completing this lab, students will be able to:
- Understand 3D coordinate systems and camera views.
- Use k3d for rendering and manipulating 3D scenes in Jupyter notebooks.
- Create interactive visualizations with camera control and transformation animations.
- Interpret and visualize transformation matrices applied to objects in real time.
- Load, render, and interact with point cloud datasets.
- Use voxel-based visualization techniques.
- Implement callbacks for dynamic interaction with voxel data.

# How to run notebook? 

Unfortunately, k3d extensions for Google Colab are in experimental phase, therefore you probably won't be able to run notebook on Google Colab
(widgets won't appear). 

# Installing Anaconda üêç and Running JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks

Follow these steps to install Anaconda and run your Python notebooks using either **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## Step 1: Download and Install Anaconda

1. Go to the official Anaconda website:  
   üëâ https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

2. Download the **Anaconda Distribution** for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. Run the installer:
   - On **Windows**: Use the .exe installer and follow the prompts (select "Add Anaconda to PATH" if prompted).
   - On **macOS/Linux**: Use the .pkg or .sh installer via Terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Once installation is complete, restart your computer (optional but recommended).

## Step 2: Launch Anaconda Navigator (GUI method)

1. Open **Anaconda Navigator** from your Start Menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS).
2. From the Navigator interface, you can launch:
   - **Jupyter Notebook**
   - **JupyterLab**

---

## Step 3: Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook (Terminal method)

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Linux).
2. Your default web browser will open and show the interface.

---

## Step 4: Open and Run a Notebook

1. In the browser interface (Lab or Notebook), **navigate to the folder** containing your `.ipynb` file.
2. Click on the notebook to open it.
3. Run the cells using:
   - **Shift + Enter** to execute a cell.
   - The **"Run"** button in the toolbar.
